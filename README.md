# Happiness
The dataset was obtained from data.gov. Since 2011, the Somerville Happiness Survey has measured residents' overall happiness and satisfaction with many aspects of life in Somerville. An initiative of the Mayor's Office of Analytics and Innovation (Somerstat), the Happiness Survey helps our local government understand what makes Somerville a great place to live and inform decisions that will support and enhance happiness in Somerville.

The survey contains two parts mainly. The first part is to assess the residents' satisfaction rating with the community services (on a scale of 0-10), and the second part is the analysis of current resident's demographic information. The goal of this project is to optimize the structure of the community from two aspects. First of all, we will explore the attributes that are highly correlated with residents' happiness levels based on the first part of the survey. Secondly, we will discover the demographic characters of the high satisfaction population and target them as the ideal resident for future references. Based on our analysis, we hope to gain some insights from the data and provide some suggestions to the City of Somerville to increase the happiness level of their residents.
